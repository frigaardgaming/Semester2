Javascript change navbar background color on scroll.
CSS code from wordpress website.

The javascript was used on my wordpress website.
It was made to help change the background color of the navbar when you scroll down on the page.
This file is only uploaded becuase this is part of my current exam.

The CSS was to fix the navbar position and the other part is to make elements only show on mobile.
